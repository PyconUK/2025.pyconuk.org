Here's a breakdown of the different event formats you can expect at PyCon UK 2025:

* __Main talks__: A wide range of talks on various Python-related topics giving insights into cutting-edge technologies, best practices, and real-world applications of Python. They're a great way to learn about new areas of interest and stay up-to-date. Check out previous PyCon UK talks on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChA9XP_feY1-1oSy2L7acog) to get a feel for the topics covered previously.
* __Deep dive talks__: Longer talks, aimed at taking a more detailed look at Python-related topics.
* __Workshops__: For those who enjoy hands-on learning, workshops provide just that! Delve into learning something new before putting it into practice under the guidance of experienced instructors. These interactive sessions are a fantastic way to level up your Python skills.
* __Sprints__: Sprints are collaborative coding sessions where people work together on open-source Python projects. They‚Äôre a great way to contribute to the Python ecosystem, learn from experienced developers, and make a real impact. The best part is you don‚Äôt have to be an experienced developer to get involved - newcomers and beginners are always welcome, as projects can benefit greatly from users helping with documentation or other tasks that don't require lots of coding experience.
* __Lightning talks__: These short, focused presentations offer a quick and engaging way to share ideas, projects, or insights. Everyone is welcome to jump in, get involved and share their thoughts with the community!
* __Sponsor booths__: Meet with sponsors at their booths to learn about the latest tools, technologies, and services relevant to the Python community. This is a great chance to ask questions, explore career opportunities, and discover how companies are using Python in innovative ways.
* __Evening socials__: Beyond the daily program, PyCon UK has evening social events. These informal gatherings may take place at the venue or somewhere close by, and have previously included board gaming, crocheting, and live algorithmically generated music.
* __Young Coders' Day__: A dedicated day for young people aged approximately 8-16 years to explore the world of coding and Python. It's a fun and engaging way to introduce the next generation to the exciting world of programming.
Django Girls Workshop: A full day workshop aimed at introducing new programmers to the world of Django (applications will run in parallel to the main conference).
