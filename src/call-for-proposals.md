  <p>All sessions on the main stage are 30 minutes long and are recorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel.</p>

  <h3>Lecture Room Events</h3>
  <p><strong>Go a little deeper!</strong></p>
  <p>Our lecture room in Space 2 has a projector and screen and is configured in theatre style with rows of seats for an audience of up to 60 people.</p>
  <p>You could give a longer, more in-depth talk than a main stage event would permit and build in far more audience participation.</p>
  <p>Sessions are 90 minutes long and are not recorded.</p>

  <h3>Young Coders' Events</h3>
  <p><strong>Help young coders (aimed at ages 8 - 16) learn and make something!</strong></p>
  <p>We have Space 4 set up classroom style, with capacity for around 20 young coders (plus their guardians) and a projector and screen.</p>
  <p>You could share something with the next generation of coders. Help them find something to enjoy, and they can even show it off to the rest of the conference!</p>
  <p>Sessions are 60 minutes long and are not recorded.</p>
