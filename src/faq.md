<p>If you're new to Python or to PyCon UK, or are just wondering what on earth "Sprinting Pythonistas" means, you're in the right place!</p>
<p>If a question isn't covered here, you can <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a> and ask.

<p><strong>Can I volunteer to help?</strong> Indeed you can! The conference relies on a cast of wonderful volunteers- people just like you. There are always lots of tasks available, big and small, if you want to make a contribution. Maybe you fancy helping to record the talks? Perhaps your inner MC is itching to chair a session? Or how about offering to assist with the reception desk?<br />
<em>If you do want to help</em>, send an email to {{ "volunteers@uk.python.org" | create_mailto_link }} and we'll add you to our #volunteers disord channel. You can also select that you're willing to be a volunteer when you buy your ticket and you'll be contacted. During the conference itself, you can find one of our friendly on-site volunteers who will be happy to put you in
touch with our volunteers coordinator.  Don't worry, it's not a binding commitment!</p>

<p><strong>What is Python?</strong> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#what-is-python">The Python website</a> has lots of helpful details on Python, including links to tutorials.</p>

<p><strong>Do you pay speaker expenses?</strong> All speakers, workshop leaders and Young Coder session leaders
will receive a free ticket to the full 4 day conference.  Unfortunately, as a community conference, we do not have the
funds to pay for additional travel and accommodation costs.</p>

<p><strong>What age is the Young Coders Day aimed at?</strong> We expect that Young Coders sessions will be suitable
for approximately 8-16 year olds.</p>

<p><strong>I'm 17. Can I come to the conference?</strong >Yes! Under-18s are welcome as attendees at the main conference. However, if you are under 18, you will need to be accompanied by an adult, who is the main ticket holder. Each conference ticket holder can add up to 2 under-18s to their ticket purchase.</p>

<p><strong>Can you help me with a visa application?</strong> If you require an invitation letter for your visa application, please first purchase your ticket and then send an email to {{ "pyconuk@uk.python.org" | create_mailto_link }} with your request.</p>

  <h3 id="youngcoders">Young Coders' Events</h3>
  <p>Calling all young coders! Join us at PyCon UK for a day of Python, learning new skills and trying out exciting projects. We'll be running workshops in the morning to get to grips with coding and after lunch you'll have the opportunity to work together and create something new. At the end of the day, you'll show and tell your creations with the rest of the conference!</p>
  <p>Young Coder's sessions are aimed at those aged around 8-16 years.</p>

  <p>Get involved with an open source project! You can pitch a project you're currently working on, or volunteer to help with one that is being worked on.</p>
  <p>You don't need to be a great coder for this! Projects can benefit greatly from users helping with documentation or other tasks that don't require you to be able to code a bogosort blindfolded!</p>

<div class="box box_silver">
  <h3 id="eveningsocial">Evening Social Events</h3>
  <p>Stick around in the evenings to socialise with your fellow conference-goers. Aside from impromptu meetups in various pubs, there are also events held within the venue. Past events have included board gaming, crocheting, and live algorithmically generated music.</p>
