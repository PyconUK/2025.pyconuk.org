Sponsor logos go here.

Try to keep the size down to about 20K if possible, by resizing and using tools like optipng.
Also, try to keep the image resolution close to that used in the sponsors page.

Width should be scaled relative to height to keep the aspect ratio.
Heights should be:
Headliner: 180
Gold: 160
Silver: 150
Bronze: 140
Other: 130

Examples:
Resize with imagemagick for a silver sponsor (height 150):
convert -resize 300X150  source.png dest.png

Note: imagemagick can also convert between formats, so you might want to grab an SVG and convert it in some cases.
      Remember to use the -resize <widthxheight> argument in this case, and check you didn't deform it afterwards.
      One way to check the relative dimensions is to run (to PNG) without size to get the ratio of width to height.
