title: Inclusion, diversity and accessibility
---

**Each year, we make an effort to ensure that PyCon UK is as welcoming, accessible, and inclusive as possible, and try to find new ways to make it even more so.**

If there is something you need, that's not described below, please [let us know](/contact/) so that we can do something about it.



## Child care üë∂

PyCon UK will be a friendly environment for parents and babies.

  <h3>Free cr√®che</h3>

  <p>
    We will provide a free cr√®che, staffed by registered and qualified childminders, during conference hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can register for the cr√®che when buying your tickets.
    We need you to register in advance, so that we can book the appropriate number of staff for the cr√®che.
  </p>

  <p>
    Children will be welcome at all appropriate conference events, during breaks for refreshments and in the audience at talks.
  </p>

<div class="box box_red">
  <h3>Feeding your child</h3>

  <p>
    If you are breastfeeding your baby, we can provide a quiet room if that's what you prefer.
    Otherwise, please breastfeed your baby whenever and wherever you like, including during talks and at mealtimes.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your child is old enough to have meals and refreshments with us, they are welcome to join us. If they are not, you will need to provide their food.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="box box_yellow">
  <h3>Under 18s</h3>
  <p>For those under the age of 18 who would like to attend the conference itself, you are more than welcome but you will need an adult chaperone.</p>
  <p>Our tickets are for over 18s only but each one entitles the holder to accompany up to two under 18s. They will need to be in the building and contactable whenever you are.</p>

## Facilities and support for special needs

We have provision for people with hearing, vision and mobility requirements.

    All talks will be held in auditoriums with induction loops for hearing aid users.

    On request, we will provide a British Sign Language interpreter (at no charge) for the duration of the conference to any Deaf attendees, to help them participate more fully in discussions and social events.

<div class="box box_blue">
  <h3>Vision support</h3>

  <p>
    Preferred seating will be provided and reserved for the visually-impaired. Please contact us about any lighting requirements you may have, and we will do our best to meet them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly, if you would benefit from having a close-up display of presenters' slides and screens, or from the provision of any assistive technology, just let us know.
  </p>

  <h3>Dietary requirements</h3>

  <p>
    We aim to meet a wide range of dietary requirements and our lunch time dishes are clearly labelled.

    We endeavour to publish a full menu for each day, closer to the event.

  <h3>Quiet room</h3>

  <p>
    We will provide a clearly-marked designated quiet room at the venue.
  </p>

  <p>
    This room is intended to be a calm and quiet place for anyone who needs to have a break from the bustle of the conference, and will not be used for socialising.
  </p>

<div class="box box_red">
  <h3>Dress code</h3>

  <p>
    At PyCon UK we want everyone to feel comfortable, and that includes wearing clothing that makes you feel comfortable.
  </p>

  <p>
    For that reason, we do not have a formal dress code. As long as your outfit does not violate the <a href="/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>, you are welcome to wear whatever suits you best.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="box box_yellow">
  <h3>Financial assistance</h3>

  <p>
    Some attendees will require a financial grant in order to meet the costs of travel, subsistence or even taking days off work. This can include discounted or free conference tickets.
  </p>
