  <h3>Banners</h3>

  <p>
    You need to send or bring any materials, such as banners, that you wish to display or use, and arrange for their collection and return after the event.
  </p>

  <p>
    Except for Platinum or Headline sponsors, your pop-up banners need to be such that they can be safely displayed behind or at the side of your booth space, as in the photograph below, or against a wall.
