Please send invoices in PDF format to {{ "kristian.glass@uk.python.org" | create_mailto_link }}, addressed to:

```
UKPA Trading Ltd.
c/o Acconomy,
Bayside Business Centre
Sovereign Business Park, Willis Way
Poole
BH15 3TB
```

Our VAT number is `{{ site.con_vat_number }}`.

We want to make sure we pay people as soon as we can.
Equally we're a volunteer-run organisation.
Thus we reserve the right to [pay within 30 days of receipt of the invoice, unless an alternative date was agreed](https://www.gov.uk/invoicing-and-taking-payment-from-customers/payment-obligations).

To avoid a delay in payment, it's important for your invoice to be legally compliant.
Please see the [GOV.UK guidance on "Invoices - what they must include"](https://www.gov.uk/invoicing-and-taking-payment-from-customers/invoices-what-they-must-include).
