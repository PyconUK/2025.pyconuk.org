### Getting around

Manchester has good bus and tram networks, but (due to the location of the venue) it's likely that **most of the journeys you're likely to make will be best undertaken [by bus], or on foot**. There's also a [hire bike scheme](#by-hire-bike), and taxis are obviously an option too!

#### By bus

Key things to know:

- You can **buy a ticket on the bus** with cash, a contactless card, or ApplePay/GooglePay (see the [TfGM page on contactless payments] for full details)
- A **single journey costs £2** – you get a paper ticket that's valid on multiple buses for up to an hour
- A **1-day pass costs £5**
- [The venue](/venue) is on Oxford Road (to the south of the city centre) and is close to several bus stops

The **easiest way to plan a bus journey** (and find the right stop) is to **install Manchester's [Bee Network app]** (you don't need to create an account).

You can also use general purpose apps like Google Maps or Citymapper, or the [web based journey planner][tfgm planner], but **the Bee app is best for**:

- listing the bus services that are suitable for your journey
- finding the right bus stop
- live updates showing where your next bus is (see the bus tracking video on the [app's page][Bee Network app])

[Transport for Greater Manchester][TfGM] have a page that documents [accessibility on the buses].

Note that there are a couple of **[free buses] that are useful for travelling around the city centre** (though they don't come close to the venue).

#### By tram

The trams don't come close to the venue, but if you want to visit somewhere slightly further afield the tram is a great option.

You can purchase a paper ticket from a machine on the platform, or pay by contactless when getting on/off a tram. See the [TfGM] page on [contactless payments] for details of how contactless fees are calculated (and what happens if you forget to tap out at the end of your journey!).

As with the bus, the [Bee Network app] is a good way to plan a journey on the trams, though Google Maps also works well.

TfGM have a page that documents [accessibility on the trams].

#### By hire bike

[Manchester's hire bike scheme] is sponsored by Starling Bank, and the bikes are operated by Beryl.

Key things to know:

- You need to **install the [Starling Bank Bikes app]** in order to hire a bike
- Pedal bikes cost **50p to unlock**, then **5p per minute to ride**
- **E-bikes** cost **£1 to unlock** and **10p per minute to ride**
- You can see a map of where the nearest bike stations are (and how many bikes are currently available) in the app
- The app gives you a brief tutorial on how to unlock and lock a bike the first time you run it

The conference **venue is just off Oxford Road**, which is **well served by cycle lanes** and is largely traffic free during the day. There are a couple of **hire bike stations nearby** (they're visible on the maps in both the [Starling][Starling Bank Bikes app] and [Bee Network][Bee Network app] apps).

### Food and drink

#### Cafés and coffee

In the order of increasing distance from the venue (and on the way if you're walking from some of our [suggested hotels]), we've got:

- [brew] is on site at the venue, on the ground floor. They serve coffee, sandwiches, toasties, and "treats".
- [Bold St Coffee] is a 10 minute walk north of the venue ([map][bold st map]), opens at 8am, does a decent coffee, and **laptops are welcome** (with personal workstations and charging points).
- [Half Dozen Other] is further north up Oxford Rd, and will be enjoyed by pastry fans ([map][half dozen map])
- Another great choice is [Federal], just a little bit further north again ([map][federal map]). They do a punchy flat white, and (if you can get a table) a good breakfast.

Slightly further north (near to some the [suggested hotels]) we've also got:

- [Foundation Coffee House] on Whitworth St ([map][foundation map]), which is also **laptop friendly**
- Pollen Bakery inside the Kampus building ([map][pollen map]), which is good for dog-spotting

If none of those are nearby, see [these recommendations][coffee finest] from the [Manchester's Finest].
