We've collected together some useful tips to help you find your way around Manchester during the conference weekend.

## Getting around

[The venue] is on Oxford Road (on the south side of Manchester) and is easy to reach on the bus. There are several stops close to the venue.

Most of the places you're likely to want to visit in the city are easily reached by one of the (many) buses travelling along Oxford Road.

### On the buses

Key things to know:

- You can **buy a ticket on the bus** with cash, a contactless card, or ApplePay/GooglePay (see the [TfGM page on contactless payments] for full details)
- A **single journey costs £2** – you get a paper ticket that's valid on multiple buses for up to an hour
- A **1-day pass costs £5**

The **easiest way to plan a bus journey** (and find the right bus stop) is to **install Manchester's [Bee Network app]** (you don't need to create an account).

You can also use general purpose apps like Google Maps or Citymapper, or the [web based journey planner][tfgm planner], but **the Bee app is best for**:

- listing all the buses that are suitable for your journey
- finding the right bus stop
- showing you where your next bus is (see the bus tracking video on the [app's page][Bee Network app])

[Transport for Greater Manchester][TfGM] have a page that documents [accessibility on the buses].

Note that there are a couple of **[free buses] that are useful for travelling around the city centre** (though they don't come close to the venue).

### On the trams

The trams don't come close to the venue, but if you want to visit somewhere slightly further afield the tram is a great option.

You can purchase a paper ticket from a machine on the platform, or pay by contactless when getting on/off a tram. See the [TfGM] page on [contactless payments] for details of how contactless fees are calculated (and what happens if you forget to tap out at the end of your journey!).

As with the bus, the [Bee Network app] is a good way to plan a journey on the trams, though Google Maps also works well.

TfGM have a page that documents [accessibility on the trams].
