**Sponsoring PyCon UK is a great way for your company to support the Python community, promote your products to several hundred delegates, and meet Python developers who are looking for work.**

PyCon UK is organised entirely by unpaid volunteer members of the Python community in the UK.

We couldn't run the conference without the generous support of our sponsors.

In return, we will ensure that your company is given exposure before, during, and after the conference, and we will work with you so that you get exactly what you're looking for out of sponsoring the conference.

If you are interested in sponsoring the conference, please contact {{"sponsorship@uk.python.org" | create_mailto_link }}.

There are various sponsorship packages available. For full details, you can find <a target="_blank" href="/downloads/PyCon-UK-Brochure-small.pdf">a copy of our sponsorship brochure here</a>


## Why sponsor PyCon UK?
Sponsoring PyCon UK will put you in front of an appreciative audience full of the best talent in the UK Python community.

 *If you use Python*, then sponsoring a community event is an effective and meaningful way of contributing to the software on which you rely.
 
 *If you’re looking for new users*, you’ll find those here and they too will be looking for new products and ideas.

*If you’re recruiting*, this is the best place to find new talent: many attendees will be skilled and experienced developers looking for their next opportunity.

*If you want to get your message across and be talked about*, it’s a great opportunity: people like to discover and share new things.

*If you want to find new development partners and collaborators*, this is where they will be looking for you.
