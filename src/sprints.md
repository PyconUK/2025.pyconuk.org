Almost all open source software collaboration takes place remotely and sometimes
at a big distance: code sprints are an opportunity to work together in the same
place.

[Link to Sprint Projects](#sprint-projects)

## What happens at a sprint?

Developers work together on a given open source project. To name just a few
possibilities of what this can look like it could be:

- fixing bugs,
- making improvements to documentation,
- discussing problems faced by users,
- making conceptual progress on a new feature.

## What does someone need to contribute?

You can contribute to a project you have already contributed to: the code sprint
presents an opportunity to meet people you have perhaps only ever spoken to
online.

You can contribute to a project you use a lot: the code sprint presents an
opportunity to have a discussion with a more experienced user of the project.

You can make your first ever open source software contribution: the code sprint
is an excellent way to get involved with the open source community.

There is no specific **need** for anything apart from some interest. However
having a laptop with Python as well as a basic knowledge of the version control
system used is helpful **but there'll be people to help with that too**.

## Is leaving before the end of the sprint OK?

Yes: feel free to drop in and out.

## If you are thinking of sprinting on a specific project at PyCon UK

Let us know. We will make a point to let everyone know what is happening at the
sprints.

## Is it OK to just drop in to take a look?

Yes :)

### Language / Core

- [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/) - The Python programming language.

### Libraries

- [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) - Pillow is the friendly Python Imaging Library(PIL) fork that allows you to manipulate images and perform basic image processing tasks.

### Sustainability

- **Sustainability Projects** (University of Manchester). The key project will be the **[Research Software Quality Kit][RSQKIT]** RSQKit is - part of the [EVERSE][EVERSE] project - which collects best practices for improving research software.  We'll focus on Green Software Sustainability content & tools, including recent work on [Green MetaData][SSIBLOG_GREENMD].

The sprint leader is [Michael Sparks][MS_LINK] ( [University Of Manchester][UNIMAN] , [Physics][PHYSICS] & [eScience Lab][ESCIENCE], exBBC R&D ). He created the original BBC micro:bit prototype (which was distributed to schools around the UK), founded the Kamaelia project, helped co-found PyconUK in 2007, and is passionate about mentoring, on-boarding, and knowledge sharing.
