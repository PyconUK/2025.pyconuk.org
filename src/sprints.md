Almost all open source software collaboration takes place remotely and sometimes
at a big distance: code sprints are an opportunity to work together in the same
place.

[Link to Sprint Projects](#sprint-projects)

## What happens at a sprint?

Developers work together on a given open source project. To name just a few
possibilities of what this can look like it could be:

- fixing bugs,
- making improvements to documentation,
- discussing problems faced by users,
- making conceptual progress on a new feature.

## What does someone need to contribute?

You can contribute to a project you have already contributed to: the code sprint
presents an opportunity to meet people you have perhaps only ever spoken to
online.

You can contribute to a project you use a lot: the code sprint presents an
opportunity to have a discussion with a more experienced user of the project.

You can make your first ever open source software contribution: the code sprint
is an excellent way to get involved with the open source community.

There is no specific **need** for anything apart from some interest. However
having a laptop with Python as well as a basic knowledge of the version control
system used is helpful **but there'll be people to help with that too**.

## Is leaving before the end of the sprint OK?

Yes: feel free to drop in and out.

## If you are thinking of sprinting on a specific project at PyCon UK

Let us know. We will make a point to let everyone know what is happening at the
sprints.

## Is it OK to just drop in to take a look?

Yes :)
